For more difficult optimization spaces (such as the ones deep networks pose), we might want to use more sophisticated algorithms. Prof David Carlson has a lecture on this later.\n",

This let's us see how our model is doing during the training process, rather than sit around twiddling our thumbs and hoping for the best when training finishes. This becomes especially significant as training regimens start approaching days and weeks in length. Normally, we validate on the entire validation set, but for the sake of time we'll just stick to 10 validation minibatches (500 images) for this homework assignment."
